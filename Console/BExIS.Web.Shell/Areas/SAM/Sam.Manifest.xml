  <Description>
    SAM provides the features to allow users (normally administrators) to configure different aspects of the application and module functions.
    It gives the user information about the application and database version, registered modules and their versions. 
    Also un/installation, and in/activation of the modules is done by here. 
    SAM also manages system features such as users, groups, permission, and dataset backup and maintenance.
